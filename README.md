## Experience
During 10+ years of productive web development I became experienced, passionate and self-driven full-stack web developer. I use technologies to work on solving wide range of problems while spreading education about web development and helping my clients and employers to achieve their goals in most efficient ways.

### React

2 years ago I decided to invest my time in **React** and I think it was the best decision I made in recent history of my career development. It’s simple yet very powerful concept of developing web components gives another level of freedom to any web developer. And tools like **Redux**  for state management or **Jest** for testing gives developers super powers on the web.

### PHP/Drupal

It’s 7 years since I became **Drupal** developer and there has been not even one day when I was not impressed with Drupal or didn’t learn a new thing that blew my mind. It’s fantastic abilities and strong community gives me passion to always learn and go forward in the field. I am equally experienced in administration, theming and module development. Also headless Drupal in combination with modern frontend frameworks opened unlimited new ways of leveraging it’s power.

Apart from Drupal development I have some experience with PHP frameworks like Symfony and Slim.
